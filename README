Make it easier to access Rest APIs using javascript.

This library depends on JQuery, dependencies can easily be removed though.
Main files

    * rest.js : core code. Have to init it with a schema variable. Then you can manipulate objects with methods R.ObjectClass.get, R.ObjectClass.update, R.ObjectClass.delete...
    * test/functional/tests.js : core tests (using QUnit). Read it to see how to use the lib.
    * test/functional/server.js : tests server, running with node.js.
    * test/functional/tests_server.js : tests server tests (using Qunit too). If you want to see how acts the server for testing, it's here.
    * test/functional/schema.js : used schema to test the lib (cf. http://json-schema.org/)
